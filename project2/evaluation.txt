Carter: Was the primary writer of the freeTrieMemory and addWordOccurence function as well as helping to get the other functions to work properly and did a lot of the debugging. Solo time working on project 2 was 4-5 hours. 

Ethan: Was the primary writer of the addWordProcess, indexPage function, removeSpaces function along with helping with the other functions. Ethan also helped with the debugging process.

In addition to the time we spent working on our project by ourselves we also spent 4-5 hours working together as a team pair programming and debugging. This was done over 2 discord meetings and 1 in person work session. Debugging our program was probably the most time consuming single element of the project.
