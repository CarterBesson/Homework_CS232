1. I was able to install "gcc" but was unable to install "gbd" on my Mac because of a compatibility error. I will use the Diamond server as necessary to complete assignments.

I was able to install VS Code, install Git, create a GitHub account and a homework repository, upload my code from VS Code to GitHub, and invite my instructor and TA to my GitHub repository.
